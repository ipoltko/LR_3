# Example: DIB-Renderer

This example allows you to train and test the DIB-Renderer algorithm for signle image 3D object reconstruction. For details on the algorithms see: "Learning to Predict 3D Objects with an
Interpolation-based Differentiable Renderer" : https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01210



### Training the network:

To train the system call
```
python train.py
```

### Evaluating the network: 

To evaluate a trained model
```
python eval.py
```
