# Example: Image to Mesh Reconstruction

This example allows you to train a simple mesh reconstruction algorithm from images. This serves as a baseline for mesh reconstruction systems. 


### Training the network:

To train the system call
```
python train.py
```


### Evaluating the network: 

To evaluate a trained model
```
python eval.py
```
