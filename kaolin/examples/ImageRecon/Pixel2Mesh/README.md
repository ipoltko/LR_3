# Example: Pixel2Mesh
This example allows you to train and test the Pixel2Mesh algorithm for signle image 3D object reconstruction. For details on the algorithms see: "Pixel2Mesh: Generating 3D Mesh Models from Single RGB Images" : https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01654.


### Training the network:

To train the system call
```
python train.py
```


### Evaluating the network: 

To evaluate a trained model
```
python eval.py
```
